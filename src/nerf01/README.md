# Nerf 01

The goal of this project is to construct a 3d-printable (with the exception of a few key parts with special properties, such as springs or pressurized air tubes) foam dart blaster compatible with standard Nerf N-Strike magazines firing standard Nerf darts, that performs better than any off-the-shelf Nerf blaster.
